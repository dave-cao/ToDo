<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is my version of a Todo list! It was created as a way for me to learn how to use databases, RESTful routing and as a general right of passage as a developer.

### Built With

Python, Flask, Bootstrap

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The following instructions will help you get set up locally. Don't hesitate to message me if you have any problems!

### Prerequisites

- [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- The [python installer package installer](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/): `pip` (used to install required dependencies)
```sh
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone git@github.com:dave-cao/ToDo.git

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

1. Click on this [Demo](https://todo-c31n.onrender.com/) link to access the Todo list. (note that loadup might take 15-30 sec)
2. You will be brought to a global todo list where anyone can see, access, and edit the todos.
![eg 1](img/image0.png)
3. I recommend to register an account, that way, your todos will be personal to you.
4. Now, you can change dates, add, check off and delete your todos!

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

There is no current future plans for this project. However, I could pretty up the page a little more. On another note, I could also migrate the database to a cloud database so that the data doesn't reset after every deployment.
